Spend hours scouring your world for rocks, sticks, pinecones, geysers, starfish or shells with the This Rocks! (Forge) mod?Â 

Do Datapacks & folder/file structures & JSON files confuse the heck outta ya?

Look no further! I did all the hard work for ya! ^^

This is a simple, easy datapack that increases the generation of all these features with performance in mind. Not so common that lag spikes overwhelm you, but also not so rare that you travel thousands of blocks just to find some!


NOTE - I HIGHLY reccommend installing OpenLoader and running your game ONCE to generate its config folder, THEN placing this datapack in the data folder! This will FORCE Minecraft to load it, even though it doesn't verify! (Don't worry, it still works)



And, as an added bonus, I included compatibility with Terralith & Biomes O' Plenty Biomes!

NOTE - Biomes O' Plenty Biomes, while supported, does NOT include sticks, rocks or other variants based off the new BoP woods or stones added by BoP, as the ORIGINAL This Rocks! (Forge) mod ALSO doesn't have variants for the BoP woods!
